# DFND-tableau

In this project, I have create visualizations to reveal insights from a data set on Tableau. I have create data visualizations that tell a story or highlight patterns in the data set. This project includes a reflection of the theory and practice of data visualization, such as visual encodings, design principles, and effective communication.

The data set that I worked on it is

Flight Delays and Cancellations 
This data comes from a Kaggle dataset, it tracks the on-time performance of US domestic flights operated by large air carriers in 2015.
